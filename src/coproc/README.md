# coprocessor

coproc is a innovative technique where two shell processes generate shell code dynamically and eval it.

This approach is strange however it allows the complexity of a difficult shell project to be split across a pair of communicating shell processes.

It is also a unique proof of concept for stretching shell coding to the limits.
