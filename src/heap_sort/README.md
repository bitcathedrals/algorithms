# Heap Sort

I wanted to explore the heap sort algorithm since there were slight
variations on implementation and I believed I had found a error
in the textbook I was studying.

## bottom up

The text book specified a bottom up swapping strategy which I
believed produced errors.

## Wikipedia

The wikipedia canonical implementation implemented a top down
approach. This produced error free sorts.
